<h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>

<p>
I’m Raj Chintawar, currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Data Science at GHRCEM, Pune. My academic journey has been driven by a deep passion for technology. I possess a good foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++, and I’m equally skilled in web development, with a keen eye for crafting clean, responsive, and user-friendly UI/UX designs. Over time, I have developed a variety of projects, particularly in Python and web technologies, which have helped me enhance both my technical and problem-solving abilities. In addition to academic work, I’ve gained practical experience through internships in technical writing and sales, which have strengthened my communication and collaboration skills. I’m also actively involved in various student-led tech communities, where I regularly engage in discussions, workshops, and collaborative projects. My goal is to continuously learn, grow, and contribute to the development of impactful digital solutions that address real-world challenges.

  <p> Title: Vehicle Detection & Motion Detection</p>
        <p >This Python project detects and counts vehicles in a video using OpenCV. It applies background subtraction to identify moving objects, filters them by size, tracks their center points, and increments a counter when they cross a set line. The result is displayed in real-time with bounding boxes and a count overlay.
